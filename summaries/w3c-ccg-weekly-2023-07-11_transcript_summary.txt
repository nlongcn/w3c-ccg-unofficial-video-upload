At this week's W3CCCG meeting, the code of ethics and professional conduct, IP and participation requirements, and data definition languages were discussed. Carson Bowman, a professor at All Visited Primm in Germany, and Karsten Hank, located in Germany, were introduced and discussed their work on IoT related issues and secure information technology and material science engineering, respectively. The conundrum of combining SIBO and legacy native formats was discussed, and updates on the work items and reboot weather trust were given. The use of C, SIBO, COSI, HOSI, and DCBO protocols were discussed, as well as tools to convert between CBO and diagnostic notation, and to order keys in a map in a deterministic way. Popular data representation formats such as XML, JSON, and Cebo were discussed, as well as the data definition format ASN1. The Compact Binary Object Exchange Protocol (CBO) was created as a collaborative effort between different packed binary formats, with Message Pack being chosen as the clear winner. The ITF has been using Baccus's formats since 1977, and the Cibola generic data model is a simple set of the JSON one. The meeting concluded with slides being shared with the public list.
