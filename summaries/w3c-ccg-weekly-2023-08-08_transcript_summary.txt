This meeting discussed the W3C Pack event, TPAC platform, and the Verifiable Credential Working Group. Brent Zandal gave a presentation on the W3C process and how recommendations move step to step. The process of standardization involves a back and forth relationship between the implementation and the specification. The W3C process document outlines the process of reaching consensus and making decisions. The VC Working Group has been working on documents for over a year and is currently in the Working Draft stage. The process of publishing candidate recommendation drafts can take anywhere from six weeks to three months. The W3C decision-making process involves working groups making decisions that move the process forward. Early involvement in standards development is key to influencing ideas and ensuring interoperability. Heather Flanagan is an incredibly talented individual who has contributed to the development of standards and is worth engaging with. It was discussed that Safari is the best browser to use with JETC, and that anyone can join the W3C standards development process without formal membership. Joining a working group as an invited expert is a relatively straightforward process, and the Verifiable Credentials Working Group is considering accepting an invited expert on a case-by-case basis.
