This meeting discussed the need for digital credentialing and the importance of wallet security criteria. The US government is investing in open source libraries with non-diluted funding, and is looking for proposals to build a digital wallet and mobile verifier. The Handle Handler API Playground has recently added multi credential verification, multi issuer support, and verifier support. Organizations are actively working to integrate with test suites, with an announcement to come at the end of September. The Internet Architecture Board has also started a new list for identity discussions. A call was made to focus on people-centric solutions to help move the war-like ecosystem forward. An industry day is being held both in person in Birmingham, Alabama and remotely over Zoom. The US government is interested in privacy enhancing technologies, but is constrained by FISMA. Confidential computing and remote attestation are being standardized to ensure security of cryptographic keys and sensitive data. A conversation is proposed to explore the layer of digital wallets, which requires a cryptographic challenge response and independent assessment. Companies are encouraged to work together on open source SDKs and can receive up to $1.7 million in funding.
