This meeting discussed the need for decentralized data networks and the use of Decentralized Access Documents (DADs) for key rotation and metadata registry. Generative DADs, emerging standards, chain proofs, miracle proofs, and DADB were discussed. The use of Ethereum blockchain, EBM, and Domain Name System to verify data rights and revocations was also discussed, as well as generative VAD methods such as PGH and NFT. Delegation chain and TKM proof were discussed as a potential solution to connecting DID methods, and methods of exchanging data between centralized and decentralized systems were explored. Challenges of the DID ecosystem, such as time stamping services and the cost of transactions, were discussed, as well as the use of Ceramic Protocol and object capabilities to validate the integrity of resources. Finally, a potential application was discussed that would generate a state proof from a theory.
