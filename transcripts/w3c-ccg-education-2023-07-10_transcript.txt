 Yeah. All right. Hello, everybody. Welcome to the Monday, July 10th, verify the credentials for education task force call. I mean, it's Terry Lamoy, the 10th driver, my comic, Terry Illinois, but really I'm sorry. I'm going to say our main topic is open recognition. Yeah. You know, Julie, he even down present here to present when we take off a discussion about open recognition and their five votes. So let me get a few things out of the way. And then we will, we will get going. First thing is to know that anybody can participate in his calls. These are open calls, but if you intend to do any work on any clinical community group, spec, then you should join the clinical community group and, and find the ICR agreement. That information is in the agenda link that I put in the chat. Follow that there. We talked to you a few are curious about the coming. I find that member of the CCG. Also note that these calls are recorded and there are minutes and everything is saved at a public page. And we would archive there. You can see it later with the calls are over. We typically send out an email from the day or so with the published minutes. Also note that we use the Tuesday. So we really pray to discuss him. We want to make sure that everybody has a chance. So if you are, if you look after question or participate in the conversation, please type a plus, like I just did in the chat and then you can also type to minus take yourself out of the queue. And before I was going to couple other things, one is introductions and reinfections. Is there anybody that's new to the call today that would like to introduce themselves. So you can see yourself up in the chat and this includes anybody who would also like to read this themselves. And one other thing in addition to typing to you or if you minus use the other hand as a lower navigation. All right, I see that you have to yourself up. Yeah, hi everybody. So I'm new to this call. I'm a colleague of John Q. Working on the solution called pockets for our state university. And yeah, I guess that's it. I'm the engineering manager for the team. That's pretty much it. Thank you. Thanks for your attention yourself. Adam. Hey, yeah. How are you? Thank you very much. I'm great. Thank you. I'm Adam. I'm just one of the founders from Tangle Labs, which is a German company that we're currently working on interoperable solutions in self sovereign identity. I had the pleasure of meeting Dimitri actually in dice in Zurich. Not long ago, and he invited me to participate because our focus currently is with UNESCO learning institutes and cities in the EU. Working towards an interoperable learner identity ecosystem. Whatever one of those will end up being. But yeah, one of our focus is actually working towards a sort of universal open source badge data model specification. So that's something that that's kind of in the pipelines is purely based on D ID and verifiable credentials. So it's great to be here. Adam, we're really glad to have you here. Hey, how are you doing? Great. Awesome. How is D web? Sorry, I'm digressing. Thanks for joining us, Adam. And I'd love to hear more about what you're working on. Maybe you should present on some call. Yeah, I'd love to at some point. Thank you. Thank you. How about next Monday? My wife's off work. So if I do work next week, I get killed. All right, let's go out for your net out. I'll get everybody to figure that out. Okay, don't see any other introductions or reintroductions in the queue. Yes, please. Take Mary is important. And I was wondering if anybody has any announcements or reminders that they would like to share. So why don't you go ahead and see yourself up and read us through money. Hey, thanks, Carrie. One quick. We are trying to close up the demonstrations of support for selected disclosure for data integrity. So there was an email that was sent out to the verifiable, sorry, the credentials community group about showing support for selective disclosure for data integrity. I'll put that email in the chat channel. For those of you that hadn't heard about it, this is basically a way of selectively disclosing something in a verifiable credential. So think if a student has a student ID and it's got a lot of their information in it as a verifiable credential. This selective disclosure mechanism would allow them to just disclose like the university that they attend without any of the other information. Last name, first name, things of that nature. So without disclosing their personally identifiable information. We are getting ready to raise a set of pull requests in the verifiable credential working group and we would like to make sure that we've got support from this community before we do that. There is a sign up sheet. So there's a presentation that I linked to in the chat channel selected disclosure for W3C data integrity. And there is a sheet that we would like folks to add their names to if they have selective disclosure use cases and they want to see this thing exist as a global standard. There's a sheet for that here. So that in here. In the chat channel, that's there. So if you, you know, have a use case or need for doing selective disclosure. With verifiable credentials, we would appreciate you putting your name down on that sheet so that we can demonstrate that there's interest so that we can push that forward on the global standard stage. That's it. Thanks. That's awesome. Thank you. Korea, you are next to me. To share that the Internet and the workshop. Number, I think it's 37 is coming up in October. Pretty early in the past 10 to 12. So just letting folks know about it. And I'll say that it's a possibility. So if you want to be there, I hope you. Thanks. So you're breaking up a little bit, but I put the link to the I would have used the cat for folks to sign up. For those of you who are interested in plus that we are planning on holding it the day before, like we did last last last time on Monday, October 9. I'm in the same location. All right. Nate, you have a floor. Great. Thanks, Gary. Serge is also here. We have an exciting announcement for this morning, which is that our beta sign up has opened today for orca, the open recognition community app. This is intended to be open source, but we're planning for an open source release around December this year with some early partner access new open badges 3.0 or 5. So we have a new sales platform also supporting open badges 2.0. The focus is on communities of practice who want to do bad weather. The badges at the same time that they're producing them, reducing the distance between when that credential is awarded and when it's consumed as much as possible. So new beta sign ups are open today. It's a wait list. We usually invite new communities in as we have capacity for them. And in addition, there's a little bit of a users group where people can discuss and talk about how to use badges for open recognition. So I'll put a sign up link in the chat here and stay tuned also for announcements on LinkedIn and all the socials today. That's really great. Good timing to you. So this call. Okay, let's take the excuse and why we go ahead and move to the next topic, which is about open recognition. So I would like to introduce Julie Keene from participate.com to kick us off. She and Don will have some slides for us and we'll leave you a discussion. All right. Well, we've been teed up very well by Adam and also Nate and there's lots of open recognition folks here. Serge and Nate and Simone and Kerry and Cheryl and Doug and Anna. So lots of folks have been working in this space. So Don and I are really just representing. We have a couple of groups that will lots of community calls that go on monthly. So we'll talk about that at the end, but I'm just going to not reach any time and let's dive into open recognition. So, Don, take it away. Great. Thanks, Julie. Can everybody hear me? Okay. Yep. Great. So, yeah, Don, for some part of the open recognition work group. We're one of the active communities of practice connected with the open skills network. I see in the list of participants on supported today by several co conspirators and I'm sure I'll be reaching out to several of them. That said, this is a fairly technical group we're speaking to today. This is a fairly non technical talk. We're just basically talking about principles and values that we think are important and should be thought about when developing these technologies. So, I thought I'd start somewhat controversially to say, you know, micro credentials and other verifiable credentials feeding into skills based hiring sounds pretty good until you start to think about it a bit. I like to call this Frank and skill Stein or maybe that steam for employers where the ideas that they can simply specify some kind of a unicorn and a little behold, there it is sort of assembled on the fly as it were. And there seems to be an underlying assumption on the part of many that were just the sum of our skills and we in our community think that people are more than that. I found this report from last September pretty useful. But it really it's it's still thinking about that idea of the hungry mouth the idea that it's just about skills is just about hiring key stakeholders being employers institutions and government. And really there's no there's no learner voice in in this document and in a lot of the discussions and also this notion about communities that Nate which is talking about and I hope we get a chance to explore more in the question and answer later on. A lot of this began before micro credentials. It began with a very expansive notion of connected learning. In other words, learning that's connected to things that you care about starting with your passions and seeing where they take you. A more can I say appreciative exploratory journey based kind of a vision and notice on left that there's online learning but there's also things like volunteer programs that could also be things like maker spaces and out of school activities. And so the vision was not only about life long learning it was about life wide learning very much rooted in the community. I'm sure some people can remember Chicago City of Learning Pittsburgh city of learning at this broke fund etc. And a lot of colleges and universities universities didn't really know what to do with this concept of learning. It was a bit wild west. They worried about who was issuing the badges whether too many were being issued, lack of assessment, lack of quality standards. And I think a lot of people also saw an opportunity to break some of the big degrees or macro credentials down into modular stackable chunks and there was a sort of parallel notion of stacking of programs that ended up being considered as a model. So we started hearing about the term micro credential on 2014 2015. Defined by UNESCO and many others. It really comes down to a lot of core certificates fairly institution center very much with a fairly top down framing of recognition, which we feel has a tendency to pull the original vision out of shape. So recognition I think is key word and it's got a wide scope outside of formal recognition the professions hiring practices because there's a notion of self recognition and even self assertion and that could be self actualization, but it can also progress to you making a claim about yourself that's verifiable perhaps you like you might do in a resume or cover letter in a verifiable way that can be supported by other There's social recognition that kind of get among peers and community that's something you may want to. Okay. That, also like straight to your own part of the word and has, you know, you're right here, and, like, and now the Whereas you had recognized other people's community and communities may be built around geography, maybe around practices, interests, etc. And that's kind of what Orca is about that that Nate just mentioned. So my company learning agents where we do consulting and we developed a framework for the Inter-American Development Bank. A generic version of that framework that expands it a little bit. And it's, it's, it's a, the attempt is to try and encompass this wide spectrum of recognition and diversity of what people are doing. So on the left, you have the more sort of micro credentialing stuff. And most of it is the assessment certificate, but it can be certifications. You're qualified for a role over on the right. It's, it's more about, you know, did you complete, of course, did you participate in an activity in the middle? Maybe you're assembling a body of evidence that may or may not be evaluated by others. But way over on the right, that's where I think the magic happens. And that's why we're here today. Things of awards, achievements, that peer issuing, that self issuing, ad hoc and more emergent. So it's more appreciative on the right and more summative and authenticated on the left. So Doug Belchau pulled this together that we are open co op. I think Doug's on the call today. So this is a comparison about how open recognition might compare to micro credentials. I'm not going to read it all, but just sort of have a look and you sort of have this idea on the, on the one side. It's very much, what's the word, a repackaging of certification certificates, etc. over on the right. It's more of sort of an expansive notion. And we think there's room for both. It's a big tent. But we do find that sometimes there's not enough oxygen for conversations about what should be happening on the right. And there's huge value there, both for the individuals and even for others in less formal approaches to to recognition. So here are some examples that have been explored over the past number of years, where it could be a self assertion like I did a hard thing and some scaffolding there saying why was it hard. What did you do? Why is that significant? Or it could be I just learned something today or somebody saying that you're a good person to work with. And if you have enough of those, maybe that starts having some cash. So, or I have a hidden talent. So in other words, I didn't take a course to do this. I actually know something already that people don't know about me and I'm asserting that here. And then over on the right, we have some interesting ones pick up the reins order and planning. And I'd like to now introduce Anna Hiliger, who's the author of these badges, formerly an intern now on the staff that we are open coop to tell her story. Anna, are you there? This picture of you. This badge as though I will talk about the different story. So I'm a student currently in a small university in Germany. And I'm studying media education and I took some time to study five months in Finland and not in. And yeah, for me, that was a really big experience spending five months in the cold winter and Finland studying media education and gender studies. I met a thousand new people and had so many great conversations. I took courses and that it was like for me. A really big thing. And if you go to the next slide, John. You can see it's in my LinkedIn profile. It's actually just a very small nine that says that I spend five months in the University of Lapland. But it doesn't really show all the things that I actually experienced and learned. So on the next slide, I put together. Like the perfect backpack of badges that I wanted to take home with me. As you can see, there's like three three different topics. So there's for when there's the personal development, the cultural awareness, but also the knowledge skills and understanding of their. And yeah, so I put them together and those are all the things that I experienced. And if I would have them in my back. I could tell my story better and like, yeah, so what I actually experienced. Already. So I think that's a great segue to this definition that Doug Belchop pulled together that which worked for a lot of us. And it's just the idea that. And I know what we can do, who are about really goes beyond credentialing and it includes recognizing individuals and communities and where those communities are. And they're right to apply their own definitions and their own labels to what they know and can do. And those can be rising up or implicit or that they can move their way to be explicit. But the point is, is that they're very much rooted in the context and the actual people, people involved. Doug, you may want to add to this. If you're there. Don't worry. So I'll just keep moving. So, and I think just to bring things back to this audience, it's, it's useful to start talking about ways of extracting value or leveraging this combination of data that can be structured and unstructured about people and by people. So, we have, for example, on the, on the bottom left, we have credential engine doing great work with other organizations such as HR open to develop very structured approaches to recognition of credentials hiring processes so HR open, for example, is my understanding is that there's a way of making a, it's essentially a self assertion that can be endorsed by others by third parties. So that's a, so it's a parallel to what is being developed in open badges, for example. And we also have very unstructured stories on the other hand that are stories in and among themselves. So in other words, a badge that somebody might have that Anna was talking about about running finish or existing in a totally different environment for a while. So, Julie, this might be a good time to talk about experience you. Yeah. Yeah, happy to. So experience you and many people on the call may be familiar with this project. It's another Walmart funded initiative. It's being co organized by education without design lab. So long is also helping along with others to basically think about how you use AI to turn unstructured data into structured data and then lay those on to digital and verifiable credentials. We are, I have a couple of colleagues here in this call that are working with a group called Work Bay, which focuses on incarcerated folks and they are sort of telling stories. It's very difficult to have people sort of self attest, particularly when they are using the organized populations. So the idea is to elicit sort of stories using transcripts and then structuring laying that on to more structured text on these at the earners within the earners control about what gets laid on to it. And then those are turned into digital credentials. So there is a T three meeting next week. Many of folks on this call will be there. And we will be presenting this project along, I believe along with 15 other projects that are also using AI to turn unstructured data into structured data. Great. Thanks. Yeah, so follow that. Yeah. So, so basically we're saying there should be a balance. I mentioned the big tent and we think there should be a way for people to invent themselves and to continue to invent themselves in ways that make sense for their lives and their careers. That's this notion of a key guy. And or this is the less preferred option, the idea that people can be assembled according to skills and put to work in that way. So along those lines, Sarah's is with us today. Well, Sarah's and Nate. We co authored something called the balonia open recognition declaration in the car on the way to an epic conference in balonia, which is Simone was very, very kind to invite us to. And it was sort of a cheeky reference to the balonia framework that for academic co recognition and we thought it should go beyond academic recognition. And these are the principles. In other words, we think open recognitions for everybody, not only to be recognized, but to recognize others. We think technologies should be able to support that. And we think policies and even funding that follows policy should support that as well. And it shouldn't just be about repackaging courses as digital credentials. So we encourage you to sign read and sign the open recognition recognition declaration. There's actually a badge you can have to support your values and put to put put those values out there, help build our open recognition community. But further back here in North America, the open open recognition work group has developed these more specific. I guess recommendations principles to bear in mind as we're developing verifiable credentials open badges version three. And just some things to think about the idea of naming your own skills and perhaps mapping those later. The idea that skills are dynamic very contextual. There's no one framework to rule them all. And a commitment developing tools and networks and ecosystem that's not just top down, but can be bottom up and even bridging up peer to peer sort of a more mesh, mesh network and the partnerships that will support that. Just to conclude. These are some of the events across the top that are going to be exploring this. We have an open recognition thread at the badge summit coming up in a few weeks. And I'll be delivering a virtual webinar about open recognition before that that will be recorded. And then Epic 2023 seven years after the baloney open recognition declaration we're still at it. And so we'll be at in Vienna and some very interesting people there, including from the South Africa Qualifications Authority. Julie ready for a CEO will be there and a number of others, including Carrie, who actually submitted a proposal just last week. So we encourage you to submit proposals for that the deadline is just gone. But also we will be accepting further later. Obviously you'd be very welcome as participants. It's really, it's a thought leadership conference. It's not about presentations as it is so much about dialogue. In the meantime, we also have the keep badges weird community, which is now re rebranded as open recognition is for everyone. And then the community opens skills network. So I think we can go to slide question and answer. Thanks, Tom. Great everybody. Before we get into that, do you mind keeping that slide up the one with the community? Oh, sure. Good. I can share the slides are in the chat, but we're both doing far less. I mean, everything encourage all of you to really look into all these different conversations. The great community of people who have been working together. I mean, really, since I was in 2011, it's the very, very beginning of a little bit of badges have been having the conversations and it means so much that these conversations continue. While things like open badges and very powerful credentials start getting adopted to more in the. I think it's done with family more than the micro credentialing degree representation, the more like formal type of learning. And recognition, but we don't just do that in our lives. We're learning all the time. And we are, we are in community and we're learning from each other. And this is part of why I'm bad just a lot initially. So, thank you so much. You and Julie for being here. And I don't see anybody in the queue yet, but I do leave you want to like, pick up or talk about any sort of discussion. Happy to like money. Sure. I mean, Oh, yeah, money you've been added to the queue. So, yeah, I'm just curious about thoughts. I mean, you know, we're doing along with Nate's or a lot of other technologies. We're really just interested in this communities thoughts about using verifiable credentials around this open recognition piece around sort of recognizing each other. How, how have they sort of be used? You know, what are some good use cases in addition to stuff that we had worked on historically around informal learning environments. Okay, Monica. Thanks, Julie. Yeah, I think my biggest question is kind of from the technical standpoint. So the, you know, the whole the concept makes sense, complete sense, right? Education or learning is not just about the all the formal pathways that we have. We also want to recognize the all the informal training that we do. And in many cases, there's a lot of that that goes on throughout kind of our professional careers. I guess the main question I have is more technical. You know, we were talking about, you know, how do we use the open badges stuff? How do we use verifiable credentials to meet the use cases here? I guess my question is, have you found technical gaps. So we're actively working on these kind of global standards right now. And we're interested to understand is if this approach at, you know, recognizing learning has uncovered any gaps in open badges three or any gaps in verifiable credentials that we could potentially, you know, patch up. You know, patch up fix up before we ship the version to work for verifiable credentials. That's it. I mentioned that there are a number of technical people supporting me on the call. So I think I'm going to throw to them pretty quickly. I would say that for us, the thrust has been issuing credentials more sort of pushing pushing them out. And there's been a lot less with pulling credentials and making well both curating them, making sense of them and then finding audiences for them. So I would say that's I'm not sure that's list that is a technical issue. I think it's also a socioeconomic one, but that would be a key gap. And that's being just sort of pumping out tons of badges. Isn't that great? No, it isn't. It's just an input. Right. So it's what what happens with these things. Again, and there's a lot of people on the queue. So I only add one thing. I was like, just knowing what happened the first time that cities have learning, at least in North, you know, in Chicago was the amount of kids that earned so many badges throughout the city through the cities of learning and never claim them or use them. So to the extent, you know, and then again, I agree with telling us not a technology may not be answering that, but the technology is being more easy, more mobile, more useful might solve some of that problem. All right. Okay. I'm next to you. So I could take something real quick and then let other people see. One thing some folks may not understand the early battle from badges previously to 3.0. And then Donna and Julia talking about issuing. It means that it's sort of different than how we talk about issuing verifiable credentials with issuing. We say, and it looks like 2.0 previously. The file is created. There's an email address associated with it. And someone is making a statement about somebody else in the posted on a web platform. Whereas this open registry point on verifiable credentials. There's this sense of the learner being in the middle of it. And the learner saying, Hey, I want that credential piece of it to me. Versus it being just given to them without them necessarily like required requesting it. I guess not a client requesting it. So that's a pretty critical change in the technology, right? Just thinking about the site needs your experience and how that might apply to open the record. I think it's something we can really explore. And also, we probably want to think more about right now. It's very, very organizational, no, the issuer center, right, in terms of the structure of the spec where we don't really be so much room for individuals to say. I am me and I am self-attesting that you can do it, but I don't think many expect that in terms of verifiable credentials. I'm going to stop there. So I think I need. Oh, Doug, I'm sorry. Hey, all of my mic to make JITC recognize a microphone. So that's all good. I'm just a plus one. What Kerry said, and thank you, Don, for your presentation. So I put something in the chat earlier, just about something I was thinking about last year, which speaks to exactly what Kerry was saying there. All of the focus really understandably has been around issuing and verifying, making sure that these people are the people who earned this thing, which has meant that really we haven't had as much focus on earning, displaying and sharing the kind of social element of it. And so that deck that I shared was really just thinking about, like, what if you mashed up verifiable credentials with something like activity, like, how could you do that in an interesting way to allow socially useful things to happen, especially now that we don't necessarily have to have the badge image. It kind of lowers the barrier to entry to allow open recognition to happen with verifiable credentials. So that's all I wanted to say. I'm really happy that there's so many talented people in this school. Thank you guys. That's awesome. I forgot about that. Yes, I forget about it a lot because we always talk about bad images with open badges, but with 3.0, it's not required. And it really does also change what that means about how the recognition is going to be used. Thanks. Mona, you asked a really good question about, you know, what technical gaps might we try and patch in this little time between now and like a VC 2.0 release or open badges 3.0 final finalization. We've done a lot of work on patching up technical gaps over the last few years. Surges on the call and the first presentation I did with him on this topic of what technical gaps are there that are making open badges weird for open recognition was in 2014 at the open education conference in Washington, D.C. And we talked about what Carrie had brought up, which is the asymmetry of the construction between the open badges 2.0 issuer, which was presumed to have a website where they could post blobs of JSON and the open badges 2.0 recipient, which was just an email address. The recipient could not become an issuer, essentially was the problem with open badges 3.0 adopting VC. Now we have a common identifier type between these two entities, which is we could use did's. And that's easier said than done, but I suspect that the technical gaps that we're going to find are really, as the previous speaker said, in the social layer of it in the service layer rather than in the data model layer for the next sort of stretch of our journey. The open badges 3.0 model is incredibly expressive. You can do a whole lot of stuff with it to describe different types of learning achievements. As Carrie mentioned, no image required anymore. So it's really flexible there. And we have this whole realm of like self assertion that is now opening up to us. The technical layer of how we actually get those individuals to become issuers and be able to sign the credentials. What technology do we put in their hands to be able to do that? That's still an open question. And then probably an even bigger, harder question is how do we as an ecosystem understand the value of all of these many new issuers. And so we've got individuals far less formal than even non traditional education institutions and after school clubs that open bad does was or is generally supported for. How do we understand the value and the composition of the many different assertions that are coming out of individuals on self recognition and peer recognition processes. Thank you. And so, so I think Nate touched on a lot of what I was going to mention. But to expand on the socio technical difficulty, not exactly a gap, but I want, I want everyone of you to start thinking about it. So. I think the. The right end of that spectrum on one of the early slides, the self assertions and the peer assertions are incredibly important, especially if those self assertions are backed up by evidence. So I can claim that I know HTML. But then if I can link to an evidence of that a project that I did a online course that I completed, it gives it that much more weight. So what's what's needed for something like that. Well, you need a way to link credentials together and cryptographically bind different credentials together. And there's several mechanisms for that we explore one of the mechanisms in in a paper with Phil and gold on linked credentials. And in fact, just these past few weeks, the verifiable credential working group added a mechanism to the core data model. Based on a sub resource integrity, but generalizing it that allows credentials to be linked together. But that's, that's not the interesting part. It's going to be useful, but that's the low level technical part. The main difficulty that we're going to run into that we need to solve if we're to have. Self asserted credentials with evidence peer peer credentials with evidence is the notion of identity and that's the. That's the bit made touched on already. So we're seeing in the verifiable credential, the growing importance of trust registries. What do we mean by that? Lists of known issuers lists of known verifiers. When I when somebody hands me a credential signed by a did and it did is just an opaque string. A lot of the did methods are how do I know that a credential signed by did example 12345 belongs to MIT belongs to Harvard. Right. We need these. These lists of known issuers that correlate credentials to known named entities. So we think using using some of the specs doing. Incubated in the CCG right now. We have a technical solution to that. We still need the hard social and legal lift of who keeps these lists. What's the governance? How do we trust them? All that stuff. But we're fairly confident that for. For main institutions, it's a solvable problem. The thing we all should start thinking about is how do we solve that same problem of identity. For individuals for self asserted credentials for peer credentials, meaning again, I hand yourself a certain credential. Or a peer credential. And let's say I got a I tracked down my professor at school. And got them to give me an evidence credential. A letter of recommendation credential linking to a project I did doesn't matter. When somebody is verifying it and they see this credential signed by an opaque did. How do they know it belongs to the professor. So this notion of. How will individual identity. Intersect with known issue lists is something that we as a community need to solve. So I want everybody to start thinking about that. And we will keep the conversation going. Thanks. Thank you. First, remember. Well, that's interesting because I think. We we precisely don't need trust registries. I think trust registries is exactly at the opposite of what we are trying to find. As a solution to recognition. The thing which I find very annoying with with some approach to. The idea that. An identifier belongs to a person. Well, an identifier even the cruises of the identifier is relational. And if we if we take the property that and identify is relational. Then. The identifier will tell you with whom we are connected. It will create some kind of a namespace. And so. This is why. Oka is not yet another batch platform, but it is focused on the idea of the community as an identity. This identity is created as speak about identity and not just identifier because this is something which is different. We often make the confusion between identities and identifiers. People will need one identifier that they will share across many communities. I think each community of practice. Can create a unique identity for a person with a member of that community. And then that person can aggregate the different elements. She has from different communities. But if you are in a community, which is. I don't know how about, for example. Then the fact that you are connected to that community is enough as evidence that when you sign. A credential. It really belongs to you. And so. We still tend to think too much about issuing credentials, verifying credentials. And. Well, there are very, very simple systems. Because the very best way to verify credentials is to look at it in context. And this is the things that we have. Explored with open badges from some time now. Is that. When you take a credential and you put it in a wallet. You lose. Ninety nine point ninety nine percent of the information which is valuable. We think that the data is within the credential. In fact, what is much more important than the data which is within the credentials. Is a data which is created by using that credential. For example. If we think in terms of a recognition. One very important element is. The dialogic relationship between individual and community relationship. Community recognition. So for example, if you have if you belong to a community of practice. You have one badge from this community. And. One person in this community as a same badge and this badge has been endorsed by an employer. If you have this recognition of this individual. Profit the community and profit the people. Was bad as not yet been endorsed because then you can go and see an employer and say, hey, you see. This budget has been endorsed by this company. This budget is individual. Okay. Not the batch class. But the claim has been endorsed by a company. And I think this is if we think in terms of community, if you think in terms of. Data usage and not just the data that are within the badge, which is very pro data. Because they are. They are extremely limited. When you look at a badge. That has been issued. You don't know how many people have received the same badge. You don't know how many of these badges have been issued. In fact, you know very, very little. You don't know if the people who have been the same badge have been documenting this badge. So, I think this is the thing which is critical to me is if we think in terms of recognition. The content within the badge is almost secondary to the data which is produced around using the badge. Yeah, just to reflect back, I think some of the things that I heard all really great stuff. So I'm hearing that. You know, from a technology standpoint, we have some of the underpinnings that we would need to make this open recognition stuff for like we've got. You know, verifiable credentials. We have open badges V3. You know, we're able to we have these kind of digital wallet things. So there's there's some fundamental technologies that exist there and that's probably not where the problem is the problem. The difficulty is a little higher up on the technology stack. It's like the platforms, the platforms that we have currently. Don't allow easily individuals to issue, you know, open badges and for us to understand, you know, to how to put that individual that has issued the badge in context with the with a larger kind of learning ecosystem. And that seems to be one of the big challenges or the platforms that we have right now. And I think it's true, the platforms that have been built to date. Very much kind of follow up traditional large institution, issue or model in what we're looking for is something more mastodon activity pub like where you have small social communities that are interacting with each other and want to issue within their communities. And ideally have that recognized externally. One thing I wanted to point out to the group is that we're actively working with the activity pub community and the mastodon community. So they're very much engaged with at least the digital signature portion of the verifiable credentials to work the data integrity work there. They're doing a number of implementations to secure activity pub messages. And that in the mechanism that they're looking at right now, the data integrity stuff is compatible with, you know, some of the stuff that's been used to secure these verifiable credentials over time. So the idea here is that we should be able to have these verifiable credentials open badge V3 O stuff be integrated with the technical platforms that that seems to be a very doable thing. And the problem seems to be a little higher up the stack. How do you change that social kind of media server such that it enables people to kind of engage on the social media platform and issue and potentially verify credentials as as individuals. I do agree that with a number of things to me, tree set as well, which is, you know, there are the idea of trust, you know, how do you trust this and do you determine it through context or do you determine it through a government issued ID, for example, those are kind of two two extremes. Or is it somewhere in between that seems like a really interesting topic for this, you know, group to try and figure out and solve. So I'm hoping that I heard those things, you know, correctly, if there are some technical rough edges with the current specifications, please do make those known we have another year before we fully ratify verifiable credentials to. So, but we basically enter feature freeze in about two months, two to three months. So if there is something that, you know, is desperately needed by this community to support the open recognition stuff. And now is definitely the time to raise issues on those specifications so that we can get that technology in there. For this this iteration of the spec. Thanks. Thank you, and then right next to me. So I think, man, who said a lot of this and also done in the chat so I'll be brief, but it seems to me, you know, there, there's a whole range of use cases in terms of what's needed and expected of a trusted network of providers and how you can reliably identify who is who. And, you know, if you're if you're dealing with something that's high stakes credential that is supposed to verify your skills for potentially dangerous activity. Like a nurse, then they're going to need to be different levels of trust. So we can't put everything in the in the same bucket, but I think it's really useful to think about contextualizing these trust networks is networks of networks. So that, you know, an informal credential, the self asserted credential can be considered in the same context as a different type of credential that has different ramifications for the trust network. Yeah, definitely. Absolutely. No one else there and I'm going to send it back to Julie and, and I'm going to stop, but, um, you know, it's interesting what I've been hearing a lot is about like context and about trust. Just a brief thought on that is that. The power of a together, whether they're formal and formal, non formal community that they can be observed together by the learner, they could be packed with them and verified like technically, right in the same way, which we never had before, which, which I think is the power here. One of the powers there anyway, with a lining of imagine you standardized. Really in that, you close us up. Sure. Yeah, go job. Yeah, go John, because I think all I would do is just to plus one what you and Deb said, and I mean just building off of the conversation. I do think that context is everything. And I think personally just getting away from an either our proposition of high stakes credentials versus kind of peer to peer technology can support all of these things as long as the earner has control over them. Great. I would say plus 100 to that. I mean, I came to this, I came to open badges through the doorway of e portfolio, which unfortunately has become a very sort of siloed kind of thing and I know Sarah's was very excited when I heard about open badges and I shared it with him and it certainly has transformed the into the words were having an epic. And I think it really does come down to the control, the voice, I guess, of the learner. And so in other words, do a bunch of badges in a wallet is that your voice. And how what what control do you have over that what how can you use those hardened pieces of pieces of evidence with a softer pieces of evidence to tell a story about yourself that works for a particular situation, whether it's joining community or trying to get a job. And I think that would be and there's big elements of technology in that that which is being touched touched on in this discussion but it's also a cultural thing almost. In other words, can you can you express yourself in this way in an ongoing dynamic way. I think that's a very important thing to do with this work. But I think it's very valuable work for people to have fulfilling lives and just putting the putting the tools and the realization that the power is there for them to do that. And so I think that's a very important thing to do with the work that the people have done to support what they have with endorsements with hardened pieces of evidence. I think it's really important and that's part of what we're trying to get at in these various communities and these various communities. So I see you making a few bit short we have to add right. Just me. There you go. Thank you. Yes, very short just to say that you know with wallets today you can show the credentials you are received. But we think that it is just as important to show the endorsement you have offered and the credentials you have issued. And I think that technology should make it very easy to show all the endorsement that has been given to others. And I don't see that in the wallets today. Yeah, agreed. No, no, I just I agree with that. Okay, thank you very much for coming today. It'd be great if you could come back maybe towards the end of the year maybe after after epic. Yeah, we can update on all of that. Yeah, we need a discussion in alignment with the very five of the credentials. Yeah, great. Agreed. Awesome. Thank you so much everybody. Bye everyone. Happy Monday.
