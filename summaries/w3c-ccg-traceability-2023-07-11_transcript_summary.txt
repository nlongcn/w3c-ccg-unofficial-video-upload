At Interop Week, Brooke from BDO's Customs and International Trade Department is introduced and the team discusses Trace Interop, pull requests, and the removal of certain features to simplify the interrupt test. They also discuss the removal of tutorials and dependencies from their Interop and Vocab repositories, as well as the importance of conformance tests and potential changes to them. The speaker is trying to chip away at small PRs and has two approvals, but warns of potential breakage. They discuss using a generic status list from 2021, Vivian's proposed changes to the delivery schedule and ticket, and the importance of having a separate question and previously defined fields with the same name when issuing a credential. Chris and Russell discuss merging a pull request to remove the proof requirement from visualization, and Option One is voted for, which involves throwing 400 errors instead of 500 errors. The group also discusses resolving an issue with a GitHub pages artifact exceeding the 10 gig max, making modifications to documentation and specs, and removing outdated information. The meeting concludes with one person taking on the task of doing minutes.
