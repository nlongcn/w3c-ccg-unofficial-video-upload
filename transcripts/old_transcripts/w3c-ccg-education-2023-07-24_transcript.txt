 or any other CCG work item you must be members of W3C's Credentials Community Group with the IPR agreement signed. If you'd like to contribute and haven't signed agreement yet, ping one of the chairs or just reach out to anyone who will help you get started. The call is recorded. The minutes in the recording will be archived over at the CCG meetings repository on GitHub. We use JITC chat or IRC to queue up the speakers and to add yourself to the queue, type the character Q and plus to add yourself to the queue. Also, if you raise your hand in JITC, that also adds you to the queue. That's very convenient. Next up, let's move to introductions and reintroductions. Is anyone new to the call that wants to introduce themselves? And also, does anyone do a reintroduction? You haven't reintroduced in a long time and we've got a lot of new people coming in for the blood fest. All right. Not seeing anyone? Let's go to announcements and reminders. Does anybody have any community announcements? Monica, go ahead. Yeah, just a quick update on what's going on in the Verifiable Credentials Working Group. Just on last Friday, there was, sorry, I'm trying to get a link to it. I just last Friday, there was an announcement about demonstration of support for the data integrity selected disclosure schemes. So I'm putting that in the chat now today. The category selected disclosure disclosure schemes there. We had a number of organizations, including a global standards organization. So like the one ed tech from the education community connects us from the retailer community in GS1 from the supply chain community, coming out in support of selective disclosure for ECDSA, as well as a number of implementers. MIT, DCC, RANDA, IDATIFY, iron VC, IFLABs, and so on and so forth, by Sabadello from Danium Tech. So there are pull requests that have been opened on the ECDSA repository in the Verifiable Credentials Working Group, and we're looking for community feedback on those. And that's it for that item. The other item that's ahead is that, and this is, I guess, pertinent to the discussion today, a new version of the crappy playground has been rolled out into the live site. It supports, we believe, the feature set necessary for plugfest 3. So it can do multiple issuance, multiple verification. You can present multiple credentials at the same time. Right now it supports everything that plugfest 1 and plugfest 2 supported, as well as some new features that plugfest 3 needs. It supports still multiple issuer backends and multiple verifier backends that might have some significance on the question that Mike Prorock had on the mailing list about how do you get headless wallets and issuers and verifiers working with Ted for this 3. And we are adding support for OID for VCI. And the new feature, the other new features that it supports is support for native wallets, as well as web-based wallets using verifiable presentation requests. So sorry, I know that was a whole stream of like new features that it has. We will summarize those and send them to the mailing list sometime this week. That's it. Wonderful. Thank you so much, Manu. Does anybody else want to make an announcement? All right. In that case, I'll do some quick reminders. We've got some good community conferences relevant to this crowd coming up in September. We have rebooting Web of Trust. In hello in Germany on September 19th through 22nd. The week before that is W3CT pack, which is the technical planning architecture committee in Seville, Spain. And the day before that actually is a very first instance of a new conference. This is distributed webcam spreading into Brazil. So this is the first time a D webcam in Brazil is happening. So if you're in the area, you should definitely come by. And then of course, in October 10th through 12th, we have IOW. And the PlugFest 3 is going to be held there the day before. So October 9th. Okay. So let's move on to our main topic, which is a technical questions for PlugFest 3. We have a couple of questions brought up on the mailing list thread in preparation for this call. One from Mike Prorock. Mike, are you on the call? Possibly not. And then we had another set of questions from Niels. And some did come related questions from Ariel. So if I see Niels on here and I see Ariel. So please, I just have to do the queue. I'll go ahead Niels. I guess you have to help me out a little bit because I'm assuming those were the questions I asked the other day in the previous meeting, right? Yes, absolutely. I have to look back a bit. But I think one of the important questions was about which versions of especially for the parties that want to do open ID for VCs, which versions of the PCI were being used because in Pro SIOP and open ID for VP, a lot of implementations are currently working alongside the diff both in C intra profile, which then is using the implementers draft versions of both SIOP as well as open ID for VP, which are a bit older implementations, but those are the current sort of versions that are used in the world much, and which are also pretty well supported in general. So the questions mainly are okay, which versions we can use in for the open ID for VC specs. Thanks Niels. All excellent questions. Firstly, let's remind everyone that for, aside from big questions like this that we can talk about in the mailing list during calls like this, day to day coordination between the various testing communities, the VC API, the open ID connect for issuance and their final presentations. All those questions, a great place to ask them is the is the plugfest three Slack channel. So if you do use Slack, please reach out to Sharon and we'll get you set up and added to those Slack channels. So mail list, Slack channel, two main questions to ask exactly these kind of questions as they come up after today's call. So the purpose of the blood fest and Sharon, please feel free to jump in here and elaborate is to demonstrate interoperability not to a particular spec, but within a community. Right. So for example, for plug fest one and two, the open ID connects participants were using, I believe, the NGI Atlantic interoperability profile. And since then the in-route profile work has been continued, we have some new profiles. So my recommendation would be, and again, Sharon, please feel free to jump in, that we asked the current set of interop profiles since that's going to be the largest presumably the largest community of interoperable software. I like to hear from Karen first before I go. Sorry. Okay, great. Yeah, not a problem. Sorry. Unmute problems. But yes, I think that's right. This is a community interop demonstration. We want people to principally work together. I think we are agnostic about which particular version are set, but we want this to be the set that are most commonly used by the participants of plug fest three that like, even if it's not the most current, or if it is, or if it is like the next version, that the agreement that people have chosen it because they think that it's the best thing for the community. And also, I think part of this is to be a little bit experimental so that we can have an opportunity to test out like what works and what doesn't work, and recorded so that the people who, including people in plug fest and on this call who are working on the various specs can take that data and make improvements that ultimately will make it more robust. Thanks, Sharon. So I see Arielle on the queue before we get to you. I want to make sure that we answer Neil's other questions on the mailing list, which is, oh wait, no, that's not. Ah, yeah, yeah, so which is, how do you prove the requirements of plug fest one, because in order to participate in three, you have to sort of demonstrate that you went through stages one and two. And because plug fest one was about displaying a credential in the wallet, the question naturally arises that if you have a API side or a system side wallet, how do you display a credential? Especially the image part. If there's no user interface. And that's a great question. I'd love to hear from the community, both wallet implementers and of course, Sharon and the other organizers. All right, so let's, the easiest way to do this is, let's go to the queue. So Arielle, go ahead. You're up next. Yeah. Hi everyone. Yeah, I think that my question is already answered by you. But yeah, because mostly what I wanted to know is about what we are implementers of did come. So we wanted to know if we needed to support the VidCon V1, which is the one that came from, from Arielle's community, or the V2, which is the one that has been transferred and published as a spec in the D. So I think from what you answered before is that we should ask on the Slack channel, right? To see what I mean, to coordinate with the community, to see which versions we are going to use in the in the plug fest. I'm correct. Yeah, that that's exactly it. Yeah. I think everybody understands that in any of these protocols, supporting all of the versions, especially going backwards in time, is not feasible. So yeah, we definitely expect the community to pick a subset that they're comfortable supporting. Okay, thanks. Thank you. Monica, go ahead. Yeah, this comment has to do with the kind of headless API driven verifiable credential, you know, ecosystem participants. In plug fest two, we added support in the the chappy playground, which is getting renamed to the verifiable credentials playground because we're going to support OID for and chappy and VC API. And it is possible for us to also support did come, but we need, you know, people to work with in order to do that. One of the things we did in the in the playground was we enabled people to provide issuer back end systems like issuing systems and verification systems. So if people remember from plug fest two, we had like 17 plus issuers that provided back in infrastructure that you could select from a list. So you could pick like the Jeff have plug fest credential, and then you could pick one of many issuing back ends to issue that into additional wallet. And at least that's how some people, you know, provided or demonstrated support for some sort of the ecosystem, like the back end providers were able to plug in as issuers. The chappy, you know, playground, VC playground has been updated so that people can plug in back end verifier systems. And that would support what Mike Prorock, I think is asking for the only problem there is the you have to be able to display a verifiable credential. So it's kind of like, is that a requirement? I think the question is, is that a requirement for back end service providers to participate in the plug fest? Because that's typically only done in wallets. It's not done in the, you know, the parts of the ecosystem that they're providing access to. So I guess what I'm trying to say is it is totally possible to provide, you know, back end from a technical perspective, it is totally possible to provide back end issuing platforms and back end verification platforms. But it's not clear if people can participate in the plug fest in that capacity. Yeah, in addition to that, actually, my real question I need is also about that is that something I guess for the people organizing the plug fest also to decide as far as I understood it, plug fest three really is about the wallet name. So people don't really have to worry about having verifiers ready, etc, which is different from a fest two, of course. So our participants sort of required to show a wallet because then indeed it comes a bit harder, of course, for a question that Mike has raised or not, or is it okay to just have agent like systems for issuance and verification and not have a UI for a wallet? Great question. And it sounds like Carrie on the queue is getting into answer that. Manu, as a, if it's at all possible, would it be, would you be able to demo the current state of the verifiable credentials playground in case some of the implementers are having to get excellent? All right, so let me get that a minute to prepare. Carrie, you're up next. Thanks. So I'm going to give news that you probably won't love. And that's that this series of plug fest really has to do with wallets. Right, this is the E3 plug fest really very specifically have to do with interactions with wallets. And this is just because of what JFF is working towards. So that is our focus for these plug fest. It doesn't mean that system to system transactions can happen. We'd love to see it. But as far as like the official participation in the plug fest, it should follow the rules and use wallets in the way that the share and subscribe the requirements. Does that make sense? To add to that, I'm really curious to ask the system wallets agent like implementers. So do those wallets really have no user interface, in which case, how do users interact with them? And what are the use cases that these wallets are targeting? And Neil, go ahead. Yeah, I think Mike should answer that one. But I'm not really aware of any use cases where you would not really have a UI in maybe with the exception of relying party systems, of course, and issuing systems itself, which are then tied to a back-end system directly line of business system. So for instance, where you are receiving requiring certain credentials, like for instance, let's say a well, education credential, which that needs to be stored in HR system or something like that. Then of course, you wouldn't necessarily have to have a UI involved, but then still on the presentation side of things, as a user, you typically would have a UI involved. So unless it's machine to machine, I see no way without a UI involved. So for instance, if you look at our software stack, then of course, we also have sort of a lower level SDKs, which you would be able to do without a UI, but there's still a web UI or a mobile UI that is communicating with those modules. So I think Mike should answer why he wants or why he has a need to do it like this. But in most situations, you would have a UI involved. Thanks. And unfortunately, I don't think Mike Prak is on the call, but we'll pursue the conversation on the mailing list. So Monu in the JITC chat is pointing out that the supply chain ecosystem for our fabric financials does not use a does not have like a graphical user interface. A lot of the workflows are done in batches, are machine to machine. And so Monu is proposing that we use the deter instead of saying wallets, you can say UI. I'm not sure I agree with that, because we are talking about wallets as a repository of right again, this sort of goes into their fabric financials data model philosophy and discussion of, okay, so what is actually a wallet? How do we define it? I think for this set of plug tests, it makes sense to define wallets as repositories of learner, worker credentials that store them on behalf of natural persons. And where issuers can add credentials into them. And then on the other end, which is what plug test three is about, verifiers can ask for credentials from those repositories. Aoty, who's on the queue? So I see Carrie, I think that's from previous, unless you have another comment and Monu. All right, go ahead, Monu. All right, I think you had asked for kind of a showing where the current infrastructure is for Chappie Playground. It's in to be renamed to BC Playground. Let me see if I can share my screen. Can folks see this? Yes. Okay, so for those of you that are new to the plug fest, this is one of the kind of infrastructure systems we use to demonstrate in ROP, both in phase one and phase two. Chappie stands for the credential handler API, which is a very confusing name because it's supposed to support or it does support all of the protocols, meaning you can, previously, you could only use VC API and verifiable presentation requests to initiate exchanges with Chappie. Chappie's been upgraded. This thing has been upgraded now to support OpenID flows. And we're starting to work with folks to work on DIDCOM flows as well. So Chappie's agnostic to the type of protocol and the type of messages that move over to it, that move over it. There's a bunch of documentation here. So if you go to Chappie.io, there's a bunch of documentation here on how you can integrate with it to do open wallet selection. There's write-ups for a fewer verifiable credential issuer or if you're a digital wallet, which is probably pertinent to this current iteration of the plug fest and if you're a verifier, there's also a fact that we ended up having to write during the last plug fest to try and support as many implementers as possible. So just go to Chappie.io. That's how you get to this site that I'm demonstrating and you should be able to run through this exact demo there. When you click on try the Chappie playground, this is the new update that we've added to support plug fest three. So before, all you could do was like issue credentials using multiple issuer backends. Now the thing that's new today is this verifier demo. So the ability to do a multi shot verification. So if you are a digital wallet, a provider, you can go here, select multiple credentials to request from the wallet and then that is delivered in one shot to the verifier. The verifier looks at the verifiable presentation and looks at the VCs and verifies all of that. So I think, and please correct me if I'm wrong, that this is what is required. This is at least one infrastructure that's required to demonstrate success in plug fest three. So there's this site. This is the infrastructure site and then I'm just going to use a veris wallet to do the demo today. We have run this demo using other wallets that pass plug fest through two and a subset of them do also pass plug fest three now, but they have some kind of small UI glitches so that we didn't want to put people on the on the spot, you know, if we were going to demo this. So okay, so let me launch into the demo here. I'm going to issue I guess plug fest three requires two to three VCs. So I'll issue three VCs and then request those three VCs from the the wallet. So the first step here is you go to the issuer demo and you select a VC that you want to issue. One of the VCs I think is the is the permanent resident card VC. This environment lets you do did auth or not. So some wallet support did auth some don't, but I'm going to go ahead and demo with did auth sign in with your did. Sorry, this is the wallet selection screen that Chappy provides. It supports both native wallets and web based wallets. It is protocol agnostic. So if your wallet supports OID for VCI, it can show up here. If you have a native wallet, it can show up here. If you have a web based wallet, it shows up here. So this is this will show any wallet supporting any protocol. I'm going to click on remember my choice for this site so we don't see the wallet selectors throughout the rest of the demo, but I'll go ahead and click the wallet that I want to do the demo with. This is basically asking me if I want to authenticate. So it's the website. This is the wallet interface popping up and saying, hey, this website, Chappy Playground issuer would like you to authenticate. I click authenticate and then I'm authenticated in the Chappy Playground using did auth. It generates an issues, the credential, the permanent resident card that I asked for. You can kind of look at what credential was issued here. And then when I click store in wallet, again, Chappy pops up, my wallet pops up and asks me to store this credential in my wallet. So I go ahead and click store in wallet and that's the issuance process. So if I go over to my wallet, which was empty before and I refresh it, the permanent resident card shows up in the wallet there. So I'm going to go through that two more times because the plug fest three, I guess requires two more credentials. I'll do a JFF plug fest two badge and then do did auth again. This is annoying and repetitive. I think we're going to try and integrate it into the site itself. So you only have to do did auth so I'm going to store the plug fest two badge. So if I refresh here, I see the plug fest two badge in the government of utopia credential. So here's the plug fest two badge. And then let's do a workforce skills credential, a safe chef certified. This is a food safety credential. So I'll issue that into the wallet, do a did auth stored in the wallet and then say, yes, I want to store it in the wallet. Okay, so that was basically what we did in plug fest two. In plug fest three is where we use this new interface, the verifier demo. Wait, wait, can you pause there? I just want to highlight. So what what Mona demonstrated there are sort of the prerequisites that we expect participants for plug fest three to also be able to fulfill to pass plug fest two, which means get a credential into your wallet using one of the recognized community open standards, which is vcapi open ID for vc issuance and did come to. So that that bit, the part where Mona just use it to provision credentials into the wallet, those are steps you want to pass yourselves as well. Go ahead, Mona. Um, game runs on the queue. I don't know if we want to take questions. Yeah, go ahead, grandma. I think you might be muted though. All right, uh, Guillermo, feel free to unmute at any point and ask your question. So go ahead, go ahead, Mona. Okay, um, uh, I guess the other thing we'll do is a verifier demo. The one thing to point out about the issuer demo is while I demonstrated web based wallet, um, it works for native wallets as well. Um, uh, the integrations, um, uses, uh, uh, URL handler to do that. Um, uh, so we're, we're typing up the instructions on, on how to do that now, but jappy sports, both web and native, uh, and as protocol agnostic and query language, uh, agnostic. Um, the, uh, next thing is the verifier demo. So this is new for plug fest three. Um, in what the verifier UI looks like here is it allows you to multi select credentials. So it says you can usually just do, you know, like one at a time, but the verifier demo allows you to multi select to say, I want a permanent resident card and I want a plug fest to credential and I want, uh, a safe chef certification. So in a single shot, you can do a request for three types of credentials. And then the wallet, uh, in theory pops up with a UI that allows you to say which one of those credentials, uh, to send over, if not all of them, and then it's sent over. So this happens pretty quickly, but what I'm doing here is I'm selecting three credentials on the chat, the playground saying that I want to receive those from a wallet. I click the button. The wallet pops up. It receives the request and provides an interface that allows me to multi select the credentials. And in this case, uh, the wallet implements like, uh, it already makes the selection for the individual and then they can choose to actually send them over or not. So when I click share, um, that, uh, set of credentials will be sent back to the verifier playground. And as you can see here, there are three verifiable credentials, one, two, three. And if I open them up, they're the credentials that I asked for. So the permanent resident card, the Jeff F plug fest to badge and the, uh, this is, what is it? This is the food safety certification. Um, sorry, right there, food safety certification credential. So the infrastructure here receives all the VCs receives the verifiable present presentation. Um, uh, and then, uh, checks the proof on the presentation and checks the proof on all the verifiable credentials. I mean, it's all, it's all, uh, right. And then it'll give a, you know, a presentation verified thing down here at the bottom. And then, uh, wait, wait, one sec. Well, so while we're, while we're at the screen and looking at the presentation, I want to, I want to highlight the fact that, uh, we are asking for did authentication of for the wallet to perform did authentication when handing over the credentials, which just means we want, um, the wallet to sign the bundle of credentials that it hands over to the relying party with a, uh, proof purpose authentication. Exactly like it, uh, using whatever key suite, uh, you're using and, and whichever verifiable credential proof serialization method you're using, but we do, we do expect the presentation to be signed. I go ahead, man. Oh, no, except if you're talking, we lost audio. Sorry. Oh, because you reviewed it. Yep. All right. Um, so, um, in, in the plug fest one and two, we used, uh, did piece. So we support did T today. We also support various one, but I don't think anyone's going to, you know, uh, I think everyone's using did key to kind of demonstrate interop at this point. Um, we can put in support for other did methods, but, you know, there needs to be a community of people that are like, we really want to use X or Y. Um, the, I don't know, you know, because, well, I'll just stop there. Putting in other did methods will require more work. Uh, it's work we're willing to do as long as enough, you know, implementers want to want to do that. Are there, is there any guidance on like, what did methods you're expecting when did off is being done? Uh, great question. So we, uh, we pulled the participants for, uh, which did method they're planning to support. Uh, and so we have, uh, we have the usual distribution. Uh, the most common ones, I believe are being did key did JWK as, as Neil points out, uh, a lot of the open ID connect for VCI folks were using did JWK for plug fest two. And then of course did web is the, the third, uh, major popular one and Sharon just posted the link to the spreadsheet of the participant responders, uh, in, in chat. So go ahead and take a look. You should be able to, uh, so gauge on which ones, uh, are popular. Heather in chat, uh, is asking, uh, and this is a great question, because it's, it's come up in, in other venues as well. Does the wallet need to handle the request for multiple credentials in one go? Or is it okay for the, verify for the relying party to ask three different times for a single credential? And part of the reason that's relevant is, uh, so some of the discussion in the open ID community where, uh, a number of the participants, uh, were wondering, can we get away with just, with constraining the verified presentation spec or just the OIDC for VP, um, spec to only ask for one credential at a time? So is it, is it sort of in the, in the letter or the spirit of the plug fest to either ask for two or three at a time or have the request be sequential? And, and, uh, I'll let, uh, Sharon and Monu, uh, and Carrie speak to that. And then, yeah, Carrie, uh, you're on the queue as well. So, so who wants to, who wants to handle this one? How about, let me wrap this up and then hand it over to Carrie, not me. How about, uh, wrap this up and then hand it over to Carrie and Sharon to talk about in, in general? What, one thing I really wanted to make sure is that, um, people, uh, Brian Richter has done a fantastic work on this. So I wanted to acknowledge, you know, his great work, uh, putting the verified parts in the playground and getting that up and running. Uh, he's been working for months to, to make it happen. So thank you very much, Brian, for, uh, putting that stuff together. Um, uh, the only thing I didn't mention here was the ability to set, select multiple backend issuers and multiple backend verifiers, but I'm hearing that that is not a focus, you know, this time around. We, we want to focus on the, the wallets. So I'm going to stop sharing and then go back into the background at this point. Thanks. Excellent. Okay. Um, and, as you might see your question about, uh, without a holder wallet, we'll get back to then just a second. So, uh, let's see who wants to hand, yeah. So Carrie's on the queue. Go ahead and then I'll share my thoughts on that as well. Go ahead, Carrie. Hey there. Um, you know, for once, everybody, I'm actually sitting next to Sharon in person because I'm in Boulder, Colorado, a badge summit. So we were just chatting about this because we hadn't actually, um, really discussed this. So I'm glad you brought it up, Heather. So, um, the preference is that the credentials be combined in, in a presentation. And that's because it's a, it's a very user experience, right? Um, you'd rather be that, okay, these are the credentials you need. Go choose those credentials package in the milk and return back. So ideally, yes, they would be packaged together, um, in the presentation. Thanks, Carrie. Okay. Let's see. It's okay. Oh, go ahead here. Uh, you're on the queue next. Hey, um, so this is a question from Manu. And so I was wondering for the verifier demo that you just showed, kind of what the format of the request looks like. Um, is it going to be something like a verifier presentation request when you click on that button to request the credentials from the wallet or, and, and so what would that look like? God, Manu. Um, yeah, excellent question. So it depends on the protocol. So, um, the, the, the, the chappy playground sash, VC playground is, uh, protocol agnostic, um, uh, depending on, uh, uh, the, the mechanism that is picked. Um, let me try to be more, more specific. So, um, we're trying to be a protocol agnostic. Um, and so if you're using, let me do issuance, for example, if you're using OID for VCI, um, then, uh, the, uh, request will come over, um, uh, using that mechanism. One way that it can happen is a VPR can talk about interaction modes and it can list like, uh, I support issuance, uh, using VC API and, uh, uh, uh, OID for VP and, uh, did come in based on that, uh, you know, message that the wallet gets, it can decide which protocol it wants to use, uh, to do the issuance process. So, um, that's documented, uh, right now. Um, and we are open to changes or modifications, um, you know, based on what the community needs. So we're trying to make this infrastructure responsive to like what the community needs to demonstrate, interrupt. So if that doesn't work for people, like, please, you know, let everyone know on the, on the dev channel or on the mailing list, and then we can try and make modifications. Um, uh, Coyote, did that answer your question? So sorry, that was the general answer. The more specific answer that you asked was like for the verified demo for presentations. Um, we only, so, so I think what's being said is, um, the presentations are expected to be, uh, multi-shot presentations, meaning that when you present the thing to the verifier, you are expected to have three verifiable credentials in there in one shot. It's not a present one and then present the second one and then present the third one. Um, we only know how to do that in, um, a verifiable presentation request. Uh, so verifiable presentation supports it, uh, verifiable presentation request supports it. Um, we don't know how the community wants to do that with OID for VP yet. And we're looking for, uh, the OID for VP community to propose something so that we can build that into the playground. So again, to be, to be clear, OID for VC, VCI is fairly straightforward because I think everyone said like you expect people to pick those credentials up one at a time in OID for VCI supports that. Um, uh, however, OID for VP, I don't know if there is a profile today that supports multi-shot presentation. I think the underlying presentation exchange object supports it, but I don't know what the community is using for, for, um, multi-shot presentation with OID for VP. I believe, uh, I believe that's currently being, um, finalized by the combination of diff and OID for VP community. So, uh, previously that we're using, uh, presentation exchange version two, I believe, uh, they're, they're racing to finalize, uh, another iteration of presentation exchange, a simplified iteration, uh, presentation exchange, let's say 2.1, four things like using it in front, um, blood vest three. Let's see, who else is on the queue? Sharon, go ahead. I don't actually have much substantive to add. I was just going to say that, um, like you, I think that like, this is a complicated issue and I would hate for us to be, um, sort of sitting down precedent for doing something that ultimately is not sort of good for the long term, like, uh, sort of vision of, uh, like this particular protocol. So I feel like, um, even though for us, the presentation, which is the package of individual credentials is sort of the goal. Um, if, um, 2.1 doesn't happen quickly enough, or if there are other sort of intermediary solutions that the community wants to try out on the way to that sort of more perfect specification, then we can entertain that. Um, I think that this is certainly to Carrie's point because, um, we see the creation of the verifiable presentation as, um, the way that it, uh, technically manifests our functional use case, which is a lot of the use cases that are either in the VC use case document or the VC edu use case document, which is individuals bundling a set of credentials for some kind of purpose, like an application to a job or an institution. Um, so we certainly want to get there as a goal and we understand that there's some complexity in there and we do want to work with you on figuring out what is the best solution for everyone, um, on this call and then for the long run. So I just wanted to say that there's not really, I'm not like adding, I think to the technical conversation, just sort of describing our functional use case. Um, but it seems, I'm, I don't know if that is helpful that I can see Neil's hand up and so I wonder if Neil's wanted to contribute to that as well. Thanks. Yeah, I can comment on that because I'm typically in the frustration exchange meetings. So to be clear, uh, version 2.1 is not focused on creating sort of like a multi-shot exchange actually, um, whether that will ever will be called part of presentation exchange is the question because presentation exchange was created as this separate sort of data model, um, uh, agnostic to the exchange protocol around it. Um, so it can be used in did call, it can be used in open ID. Um, uh, it could be even used in, um, the, um, VC API if you want to. So a focus of 2.1 definitely not is, is having a sort of, um, protocol around that which allows you to do multi-shot exchanges. Um, so that will not be happening for 2.1. What will be happening for 2.1 is, uh, we are looking at, um, making presentation exchange a bit simpler, um, and also removing some potentially, um, uh, some potential issues with security around how it's using JSON path, for instance, in, uh, presentation exchange and, and, uh, I don't want to come to technical about it, but those are the focus of 2.1. Uh, and we're still looking at whether we can get them in 2.1, uh, or whether we have to go to 3.0, um, uh, because of potential change we have to make, uh, which would not be backward compatible. Niels, do you, uh, thank you so much for clarifying. Do you remember, uh, in the did come to world, uh, is it not fairly common to be able to request multiple credentials? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. So of course there you have the, the, the prevent proof protocol. Which indeed is a protocol which can use presentation exchange. Um, and I, I, to be honest, I'm currently not too much in, uh, in the meetings with the Open ID folks, uh, just because I, I am too busy. Well, I can imagine that something around that would also be created. And, um, uh, in all honesty, there's a little bit of a political discussion between the Open ID folks and the presentation exchange folks. Um, so the question really is where the presentation exchange will end up in the Open ID later versions or not. Um, that's still an outstanding sort of question that the two communities are trying to solve and, um, but indeed in, in did come with it too. Um, yeah, you could definitely have this exchange mechanism in which you have multiple rounds of exchanges of credentials. Thank you. Anyone else? All right. And any other questions, uh, the people have that we can answer in the next eight minutes, uh, that we have? Excellent. That means we answered all questions. No, so we encourage obviously we have a couple of, these open discussions about, uh, what are we considering as, um, uh, headless wallets and, and whether such a thing can exist on the learner worker level. Yeah, this, this notion of what do the Open ID for the P folks do, uh, for, for multiple credentials that that's still sort of, um, under discussion. So we're going to continue these conversations on the mailing list and in the Slack channel. And of course, I'm not sure whether, Mashaire and Carrey and are planning another one of these, uh, plug fest specific VC edge calls before September, October rather. All right. Yeah. So Carrey mentions in chat that, uh, we can schedule another one of these calls if there's demand for it. Carrey, go ahead. So I was only wondering in terms of this OIDC for, um, those of you who are using that, when, when would be a good time, like a good timing for us just to make a final decision on it? Because it sounds like we don't know when decisions will be made and should we, um, yeah, I just want to put you all like, make you wait on us for this. So let us know when you think you really want to know the answer by and we'll just go with that for, for this flood test, just so you're not replying. And yeah, olacy. So some mono and chat is saying. Yeah, so news pointed out that. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, I'm thinking out loud with Nils on how ID for VP could possibly work for this plug fest. If they can only do or if it can only do single shot credentials now. There's a possibility of us adding something to the VC playground that keeps state on the server that will receive multiple ID for VP presentations one at a time and then do the binding of all those credentials together on the server. But I mean, like this is there's there's probably a better way to do this. So I'm sorry. I didn't want it to come across as like that's the only way it could work. Clearly, the community probably has a better mechanism than that. That's it. Yes. So if you ask me. Sorry for interrupting. I wasn't the cue by the way. It has to be one platform just with multiple credentials because that's the point. You could have multiple authorization request. The authorization responses are connected to. But those are not the right to go by an oppressive data exchange, but maybe David has something to say. Thank you and. David. Welcome. Go ahead. Yeah, I just want to say that crossword and spruce did do into working tests of presentations using IDC where multiple presentations could be requested using IDC for VP. Now that was at the end of last year. Okay, so we're talking about November 22. This year I haven't really participated much in the IDC and how it's evolved. And so it would be a retrograde step in my opinion if IDC reverted to just asking for one credential when it could actually ask for many previously. But I'm hoping to start attending the IDC meetings again shortly. Wonderful. Thank you, David. And we appreciate your leadership in the previous blog fest as well as this one real quick before. Before we adjourn, one of the questions from I think it was the mailing list asking specifically what is the verifier going to verify on the other end. As we know in the community there's difference between verification and validation. The application being essentially just checking the signature and then validation can have any number of steps that are business rule specific so. expiration whether or not the issuer is in a known issuer list. All sorts of other steps so. For plug fest three we're just. expecting the signature to validate. And we do expect did authentication. Slashholder binding meaning. Verifier presentation that gets handed off by the wallet needs to be signed with the user did. So hopefully the answer is that question. Anyone else last moment? Hi, then. Hello. Hi, I have a question because. Yeah, I wanted to know is it like this is like is it like a black first two like a shoe. Also like in black first two issue can was able to participate right. So is that here in black first three also verify can participate or only the wallet providers like the hold of others only can. credential works I can participate here. Oh, great question that's that's over to Sharon can issuers. Either participate or I don't know get a badge for the previous. Blood test versions. I mean, okay, so I okay, so this is a great question because one of the ongoing conversations that we have is how to continue to grow this community and obviously we want. The community of issuers to be able to issue credentials into multiple as well. So I don't have the solution for you right now, but I think that we will have an answer to your question in the next two to four months as far as like what we do. For right now, I think out all of the documentation and the credentials and the technical information for what issuers did to earn their. Like this to batch were available are available on the plug this to website. So you should feel free to play around with that send me a message if you would like to talk more about this and. You can be part of like the solution that we create. My question is here in the platform street. It's like verify can participate who can verify the open batch. Yes, so if you if you have a verifier solution, I would love to talk to you. So definitely send me a note and like we'll try to work that out. Okay. Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Azim. Thank you, Sharon. All right, we are at the top of the hour. Thank you everyone. If there's any questions you've left unanswered, I was asked on the VC edgy mailing list and on the Slack channel. Thanks again. See you all next week.
