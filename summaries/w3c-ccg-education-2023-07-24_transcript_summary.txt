The W3C Credentials Community Group requires members to sign an IPR agreement and join the group. At a meeting, a demonstration of interoperability within a community was proposed. Participants must be able to display a verifiable credential in order to participate in Plug Fest Three, which is focused on wallet names and interactions with wallets. Chappie.io provides documentation on how to integrate with it to do open wallet selection and verifiable credential issuer, and the Chappie playground update supports Plug Fest Three. The Verifier Demo allows users to multi-select credentials and send them over to a wallet in a single shot. DID Auth was discussed as a way to authenticate with any wallet supporting any protocol. At the Boulder Badge Summit in Colorado, Brian's work on wallets for verified parts in the playground is being acknowledged. The IDC is discussing a potential solution to binding multiple credentials together for VP presentations, and is considering reverting to asking for one credential. Verifying open batches is possible, and those with verifier solutions are encouraged to contact the speaker for further discussion.
