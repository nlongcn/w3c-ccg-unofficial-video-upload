The Keep Badges Weird community has been rebranded as Open Recognition. The Open Recognition Work Group has developed principles and recommendations to support open recognition for everyone. Events such as the Badge Summit and a virtual webinar will explore these topics. Technical gaps were identified in the process of issuing, curating, making sense of, and finding audiences for credentials. Don and Kerry discussed the importance of verifiable credentials and how Open Badges 3.0 adopted VC to create a common identifier type. Mona asked a question about technical gaps that need to be patched. The group agreed to reconvene at a later date to discuss credentials and updates.
