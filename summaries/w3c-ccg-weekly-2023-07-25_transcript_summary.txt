At a meeting, the digital community discussed the use of verifiable credentials and the need for general purpose VC display methods. They discussed the use of templates to help busy implementers, and the need for VCs to be translated into different modes such as visual, audio, tactile, and constrained visual environments. Additionally, the Verifiable Credential Data Model has a mechanism built in to allow for translation into multiple languages. The group discussed the conflict between open wallet ecosystems and strong control when it comes to credential rendering, and solutions such as attestations and key management are being explored. They also discussed the Render Method design pattern and how it could be used to create a programmatic SVG to render a CLR V2 or presentation. The meeting concluded with a link to the slides and everyone cheering.
