At a meeting, a group of people discussed the need to review their interoperability test results, focusing on vocab, trace and trap, and the failure on the interrupt. They discussed the need to validate the conformance suite, with a focus on credential subject ID, credential issue, and formatting. A plan was proposed to import and run the suite locally to determine the issue. They discussed changes to the credential workflow, including adding a new column to the summary page and breaking down the data by company or product. They also discussed changes to the steel demo, including the ad credential status to bank account credential, PR number 8 to 20, and workflow changes. They discussed sorting by oldest or most recently updated, and concluded that sorting by oldest was the best option. They discussed two PRs (820 and 841) to fix missing fields and entry numbers in an example, and PR 842 to consolidate two similar schemas. They discussed a change request to modify the client scope to pass either a secret value or an empty string, and tests to be modified to either pass the secret value or an empty string. They discussed the use of JSON Web Key and JSON Web Key 2020 for data integrity context definitions, and the need to update terms and avoid conflation of terms within the same class. They discussed ISO standards, the max size limit for Jason L, credentials, and tests and standards for a mill test. They discussed the upper limit per document when storing data in Mongo, and the customer call that suggested guidance on the issue. They agreed to update action items to use date time where relevant, and to create a PR to define the scope. They also discussed switching the vocabulary for terms in a PDF document. Lastly, they discussed uploading minutes and audio, and Chris volunteered to trigger a run and keep an eye on it.
