Brent Zandal, an employee of Jen, presented on the W3C process and the importance of getting involved early in the standards development process. The process of standardization involves refining ideas through conversation and implementation. The W3C process document outlines the steps for creating a charter for a new group, which is necessary for producing recommendations. The VC Working Group has been working on documents for over a year and is currently in the Working Draft stage. Heather Flanagan is an example of an individual who has contributed to the development of standards. The meeting concluded that Safari is the best browser for using JETC, and a link to the slide deck will be provided. It was discussed that there are multiple ways to participate in standards development, such as having a great idea and finding a team to help push it forward. Applying to join a working group as an invited expert is a relatively straightforward process.
